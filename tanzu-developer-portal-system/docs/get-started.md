The VMware® Tanzu Developer Portal™ provides your development teams with a single place where they can create, document, observe, and manage the enterprise applications they care for. Here are some tips to get you started with the Tanzu Developer Portal.

## Navigating the UI

Over on the left you'll find a side panel where you can navigate around the different features of the portal. This panel can be expanded and contracted by clicking on the chevrons at the top.

* [**Search**](#find-what-you-need) is whee you can enter queries and search for items.
* [**Home**](#discover-existing-stuff-in-home) is where you'll find the software catalog.
* [**Docs**](#browse-your-technical-documentation) contains links to all the technical documentation (TechDocs) registered with the portal.
* [**APIs**](#locate-your-apis) details the application programming interfaces registered with the portal.
* [**Create**](#start-a-new-project) provides multiple application accelerators (code templates) for new projects.
* [**Settings**](#customize-your-experience) lets you customize your portal experience.

## Find What You Need

The Tanzu Developer Portal includes a system wide search facility that can help you find information stored within the system. Your [technical documentation](#browse-your-technical-documentation), [API's](#locate-your-apis), [software catalog entries](), [application accelerators](#start-a-new-project), and more are indexed by the system.

## Discover Your Software Catalog

The Tanzu Developer Portal's software catalog (labelled 'Home' in the navigation) offers deep contextual awareness of what components are available, the APIs and documentation for them, and the critical details of who owns each piece.

You can filter the catalog by category (Components, APIs, Systems, Users, etc.) or by owner, lifecycle, tags, etc.

## Browse Your Technical Documentation

Applications (components, systems, etc.) can have register their technical documentation hosted by the portal so that it's easy to find and share amongst all your teams. These documents are searchable, written in markdown, and can live alongside your code (if that's your preferred location).

## Locate Your APIs

APIs available to developers can be listed, shared, and documented using common standards such as OpenAPI (some may know this as Swagger). APIs registered here in this way have a high degree of utility. You can

## Start A New Project

[Application Accelerators](accelerators.md) (labelled 'Create' in the navigation) provide ready made and pre-approved coding project templates which you can customize and download. These templates drastically shorten the time taken to begin new projects. They encourage the use of your best practices for application design and help you stay on the golden path.

Better yet, you can create your own application accelerators and share them with other portal users. This will help you standardize on common tools, and eliminate the time you normally waste adding common libraries or configuration.

## Customize Your Experience

The settings panel is where you will find access to the "light" and "dark" modes for the UI as well as other information such as your profile details (if you have a profile).
