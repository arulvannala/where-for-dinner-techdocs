# FAQs

Here are some common questions people have about Welcome To VMware® Tanzu Developer Portal™.

## Q: I am a current VMware Tanzu Application Platform customer. Do I need to acquire the Tanzu Developer Portal separately to enjoy its features?

A: No, as an existing Tanzu Application Platform customer, you shall receive Tanzu Developer Portal entitlements in the 1.6.0 release.

## Q: Are there limitations to the Backstage plugins that I can integrate in my Tanzu Developer Portal?

A: As a general principle, we aim to make any Backstage plugin compatible with Tanzu Developer Portal. Our configurator tool operates with “surfaces” that informs it how to integrate the plugin’s code into the portal. As of the initial release, we are enabling the most commonly used surfaces. For more information, please refer to [TAP Docs link - API surfaces].
