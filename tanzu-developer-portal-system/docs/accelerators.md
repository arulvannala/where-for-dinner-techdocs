# Application Accelerators

Application Accelerators help you bootstrap the process of developing new applications by providing "ready-made" coding project templates. Accelerators help you 'codify' all your best practices, preferred libraries, and deployment processes into one repeatable, easy to use interface.

Enterprise Architects, Developers, and Operators can author and publish accelerator projects that provide the teams in their organization with ready-made, conforming code and configurations.

Published accelerator projects are maintained in Git repositories. You can then use Application Accelerator to create new projects based on those accelerator projects.

The Application Accelerator user interface(UI) enables you to discover available accelerators, configure them, and generate new projects to download.
