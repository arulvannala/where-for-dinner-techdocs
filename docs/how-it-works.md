You use the Where For Dinner application to search for availability at dining establishments.  

Unlike other search applications that provide on-demand results of dining availability in real time, Where for Dinner attempts to ease the frustration of obtaining reservations at establishments that have limited availability (i.e. they are hard to get into).  Real time searches at these types of establishment tend to always show no availability and forces a user to either continually hit a *search* button or come back to the reservation site multiple times to check if availability has opened. This is where Where for Dinner steps in; it takes a set of search parameters such a time window, establish name, establishment type, and/or zip code and continually searches for availability on the users behalf.  The user can come back at a later time and check to see what availability the application has found.  Where For Dinner continues searching and updating availability results as they change.  A real time event module can also be added that sends real time notifications to a user over a configured medium such as SMS, email, or a proprietary application.
