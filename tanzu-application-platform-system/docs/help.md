You can get help with the Tanzu CLI from the tool itself. Most (if not all) of the commands have help available for them. To get help, use the command `help`. Below are some examples.

Get help with the tool itself:

```bash
tanzu help
```

Get help with the **apps** plugin:

```bash
tanzu apps help
```

Get help manipulating **workloads** with the apps plugin:

```bash
tanzu apps workload help
```

List all plugins (including both installed and not installed):

```bash
tanzu plugin list
```

Get the version of your `tanzu` cli tool:

```bash
tanzu version
```
